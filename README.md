# NLP transformers
This repo contains my transformer implementation (heavily inspired by Peter Bloem's great tutorial on transformers [here](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers)), and 
a few different transformer based NLP models for various tasks such as
 - Next character generation with enwik8

Each model has a playground python script that can be used to dynamically interact with a model after it's been trained.
Note that pretrained models are unfortunately not included at this time due to file size limitations.

TODO: Add a gif of the playground in use with a model.

This list will hopefully be expanded in the future!
